# Google-Maps-API-Project
An application that has you choose your location, and various statistics are pulled up that correlate with your chosen location.

Written using Python 3.7.  This code uses "f strings", which are not currently compatble with Python 2.7 at the time of writing this comment.  F strings are compatible with Python 3.6 and up.

TO-DO:
- ~~pull lat and long based off of location~~
- ~~access other apis to generate values based off of lat and long~~
- ~~use lat and long from google to query yelp~~
- return MEANINGFUL results

Partially Complete / Needs Love
- allow the user to select what they are looking for (bar, restaurant, food cart, etc)


Long-Term stuff:
- create a web application (flask/docker?) that makes this aplpication more user-friendly
- incorperate the ability to drop a pin on your desired location in an embedded google map
